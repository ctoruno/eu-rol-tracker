    "You are an assistant with knowledge and subject-matter expertise on Rule of Law, justice, governance, global politics, social sciences, and related fields in the European Union. Your task is to carefully read a news article and determine whether it is related to the definitions of Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance that I will give you.

    "# Key macro concepts\n",
    "Here are the definitions of Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance:\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Rule of Law?\n",
    "The term Rule of Law refers to a system in which law is able to impose meaningful restraints on the state and individual members of the ruling elite. It refers to a governance principle in which all persons, institutions, and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extend this concept further by defining the Rule of Law as a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld. First, the government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law. Second, the laws are clear, publicized, stable, and fair, and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and property. Third, the process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, and efficient. Lastly, access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and judicial officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the previous definitions, we can infer that the Rule of Law is a multidimensional concept that extends over eight basic pillars: limited government powers; absence of corruption; order and security; fundamental rights; open government; effective regulatory enforcement; access to civil justice; and an effective criminal justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a political science perspective, these factors draw on four basic ideas related to the relationship between the state and the civil society: the checks and balances on the government's power, the effectiveness of the state in performing its basic functions, participation and collaboration between the state and its citizens, and absence of arbitrary abuse by the authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Justice? \n",
    "We define Justice as the ethical, philosophical idea that people are to be treated impartially, fairly, properly, and reasonably by the law and by arbiters of the law, that laws are to ensure that no harm befalls another, and that, where harm is alleged, a remedial action is taken - both the accuser and the accused receive a morally right consequence merited by their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justice also refers more specifically to the set of institutions and services that allow for the impartial mediation and adjudication of disputes arising from the violation or conflicting interpretations of laws, including the enforcement of decisions or agreements reached through their operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Governance? \n",
    "Finally, we define Governance as the mechanisms, processes, and structures through which public institutions operate and make decisions for the welfare and benefit of their respective communities. This encompasses the way governments and local authorities are organized, how policies are formulated and implemented, how resources are allocated and managed, and how public services are delivered to citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "# News article and instructions\n",
    "Now, given the following news article:\n",
    "News title: {headline}\n",
    "News summary: {summary}\n",
    "News body: {body}\n",
    "\n",
    "Please analyze the news article and its context, and answer the following question:\n",
    "1. Based on the definitions that I just provided above, is this news article narrating events related to the Rule of Law, Justice, or Governance?\n",

    "    country: answer to question number 2.\n",
    "}}\n",
    "\n",
    "When answering, strictly attach to the definitions of the Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance and keep in mind the following points:\n",
    "1. We do not include the right to access to healthcare in the conceptual framework of the Rule of Law because we are not contacting public health experts in this project, so news articles which main topic is the right to healthcare should not be related to the Rule of Law.\n",
    "2. It is very important to distinguish between different types of news: description of events, interviews, op-eds, public statements, to clarify whether the news article has any actual impact on the Rule of Law, Justice, or Governance.\n",
    "3. Opinion columns and opinion articles in general should not be related to the Rule of Law, Justice, and Governance.\n",
    "4. Any news article referring to foreign policy or international diplomacy should be rated as unrelated to all the pillars of the Rule of Law.\n",
    "5. We are only interested in current or recent events related to the Rule of Law. Therefore, please label articles referring to historical events in the far past as UNRELATED to the Rule of Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very important key point to keep in mind: Our conceptual framework does NOT include war, armed conflict, or peace agreements. Therefore, news articles narrating events that derive from war, armed conflict, or peace agreements, or events that are a direct consequence from the previous situations should be labelled as UNRELATED to the Rule of Law.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, I will provide you with detailed definitions for each pillar.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pillars of the Rule of Law\n",
    "1. Constraints on Government Powers: \n",
    "Measures the extent to which those who govern are bound by law. It comprises the means, both constitutional and institutional, by which the powers of the government and its officials and agents are limited and held accountable under the law.

    "\n",
    "4. Fundamental Rights\n",
    "This pillar recognizes that a system of positive law that fails to respect core human rights established under international law is at best “rule by law,” and does not \n",
    "deserve to be called a rule of law system. This aspect focuses on rights that are firmly established under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, but \n",

    "6. Regulatory Enforcement and Enabling Business Environment\n",
    "Measures the extent to which regulations are fairly and effectively implemented and enforced. Regulations, both legal and administrative, structure behaviors within and outside of the government.

    "    -\tWhether environmental and labor regulation authorities sanction violations, such as occupational safety and business license or zoning violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Civil Justice\n",
    "Measures whether ordinary people can resolve their grievances through formal institutions of justice in a peaceful and effective manner, as well as in accordance with generally accepted social norms rather than resorting to violence or self-help. Access to civil justice requires that the system be accessible, affordable, effective, impartial, and culturally competent. In more detail, this pillar is related to the following topics:\n",

    "Evaluates a country’s criminal justice system. An effective criminal justice system is a key aspect of the rule of law, as it constitutes the conventional mechanism to redress grievances and bring action against individuals for offenses against society.

    "    -\tWhether trials are timely, outcome-oriented, impartial, and free of corruption and undue influence from political and private interests.\n",
    "    -\tWhether alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (ADRs) are available, accessible, affordable, impartial, timely, effective, enforceable, and free of corruption and undue influence from the government and private interests.\n",
    "    -\tWhether victim’s rights are effectively guaranteed, including treatment with respect, absence of discrimination, timely and sufficient information, and protection.\n",
    "    -\tWhether the basic rights of criminal suspects are respected, including the presumption of innocence and the freedom from arbitrary arrest and unreasonable pre-trial detention. It also measures whether criminal suspects are able to access and challenge evidence used against them, whether they are subject to abusive treatment, and whether they are provided with adequate legal assistance. In addition, it measures whether the basic rights of prisoners are respected once they have been convicted of a crime.\n",
    "    -\tWhether the prison system guarantees conditions of safety and order and respects the rights of people deprived of their liberty. It also measures the absence of corruption and the effectiveness of the prison system in reducing recidivism.\n",

    "    }}\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: As you saw, each pillar measures a wide range of elements, and they tend to overlap in various aspects. On the other hand, the news articles describe events that take place in a specific country, territory, or region.
