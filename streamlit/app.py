    Welcome to the EU Rule of Law Tracker, a pilot project aimed at systematically tracking, classifying, 
    and analyzing social and political events related to the rule of law across the 27 member states 
    of the European Union. This initiative makes use of news articles archives and Large Language Models 
    (LLM) in order to produce a systematized database for researchers to assess and validate perceptions 
    on the rule of Law in the targeted countries.
